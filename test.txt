When I worked in New York City, I took the fast train from New Jersey to work early in the morning. Thankfully, I was an early riser and heard my alarm go off since I was a light sleeper. Before heading out for a busy workday, I always made the effort to make my bed. I liked to make the time to do so before starting my day, so when I got home my bed was not a mess. Spending the time to be organized in the morning allowed me to relax when I arrived home after a long day at work.
